## Approach ðŸ’¡

After Extraction and cleaning of dataset I applied various Machine Learning and Deep Learning model to get good accuracy.

### Choosing the best features and applying Baseline models

To find the best combination of features, I used Bag of Words model. First text was converted to Tf-idf vectors and then these vectors were fed to the following models :-

1. #### Linear SVC
2. #### Naive-Bayes
3. #### Logistic Regression
4. #### Random Forests
